Terminologies:
        Circuit:
        A circuit is a huge mathematical expression used by the system to calculate the outputs and the proof
        Circom:
        Efficient circuit framework for programmable zero-knowledge
        Circomlib:
            A programming library with many useful predefined circuits
        Poseidon hasher from circomlib to generate the input Poseidon hash
            This hash will prove we know the input w/o revealing it
            First step, we compile the circuit by the circom compiler that will generate a wasm and an r1cs file
        Proving Key    
            To generate the proof, we need a proving key file, and to generate this file, we need a ptau file
        PTAU File    
            This ptau file can be generated by snarkjs, In prod recommended to do the ceremony and generate your own ptau file
        Proof generated using zksnarkjs
            We provide input data, circuit and proving key
            We get outputs of the circuit (publicSignals) and the proof
        Verification Key - to verify the proof derive from proving key
            Generated from the proving key to verify the proof
        To Verify need - verification key + public signal + proof

        {
            Circuit Creation A circuit is created to represent the statement that the prover wants to prove. 
                A circuit is a mathematical representation of a computation or a relationship between values. 
                For example, a circuit could represent a transaction in a cryptocurrency, a digital identity, 
                    or any other computational task.
            Proving Key Generation: The prover generates a proving key, which consists of a set of parameters 
                that define the circuit and its associated cryptographic keys. 
                The proving key is kept secret by the prover and is used to generate proofs.
            Statement Input and Witness Computation: The prover inputs the statement that they want to prove, 
                along with any additional information called a "witness", which contains the values that 
                satisfy the circuit. The circuit evaluates the statement and the witness to produce an output, 
                which is typically a set of constraints that can be represented as mathematical equations.
            Proof Generation: The prover uses the proving key and the output of the circuit to generate a proof. 
                The proof is a cryptographic construction that attests to the truthfulness of the statement 
                and the correctness of the witness, without revealing any additional information about the 
                statement or the witness.
            Verification Key Distribution: The prover sends the proof and the statement to the verifier, 
                along with the verification key. The verification key is derived from the proving key and 
                is used by the verifier to verify the proof.
            Proof Verification: The verifier receives the proof, statement, and verification key from the prover. 
                The verifier then uses the verification key to verify the proof. If the proof is valid, the verifier 
                can be sure that the statement is true and the witness is correct, without learning any additional information 
                about the statement or the witness.
            Trust Establishment: Once the proof is verified, the verifier establishes trust in the truthfulness of the statement 
                without knowing any additional information about the statement or the witness, 
                thereby achieving privacy and confidentiality.

Explaination:
Zero-Knowledge Proof (zk-proof) can be used to prove that your age is greater than 30 without revealing your actual age, using the concept of proving key, verification key, proofs, and circuit usage.

Circuit Creation: A circuit is created to represent the relationship "age > 30". The circuit takes as input your age and the value 30, and computes the result of the comparison "age > 30".

Proving Key Generation: A proving key is generated by a trusted party, such as a third-party authority or yourself. The proving key includes the parameters that define the circuit and its associated cryptographic keys. The proving key is kept secret by the prover.

Statement Input and Witness Computation: You input your actual age (e.g., 35) as the statement, and compute a witness that satisfies the circuit. In this case, the witness would be the difference between your actual age and 30 (e.g., 5), which is the value that satisfies the "age > 30" relationship.

Proof Generation: You use the proving key and the witness to generate a proof. The proof is a cryptographic construction that attests to the truthfulness of the statement "age > 30" and the correctness of the witness (i.e., the value 5), without revealing your actual age.

Verification Key Distribution: You send the proof, statement "age > 30", and the verification key to the verifier. The verification key is derived from the proving key and is used by the verifier to verify the proof.

Proof Verification: The verifier receives the proof, statement, and verification key from you. The verifier then uses the verification key to verify the proof. If the proof is valid, the verifier can be sure that your age is indeed greater than 30, without learning your actual age or the witness value.

Trust Establishment: Once the proof is verified, the verifier establishes trust in the fact that your age is greater than 30, without gaining any knowledge of your actual age or the witness value, thereby achieving privacy and confidentiality.
